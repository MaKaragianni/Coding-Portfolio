<b>1. UniBuddy Chatbox Program:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> The UniBuddy Chatbox is a Python-based interactive chatbot designed to assist university freshmen by providing personalized support and information.
It starts by collecting basic information from the user, such as name, age, etc.
Leveraging this information, UniBuddy delivers personalised responses and can answer predefined questions about university life, including sports, student support services, libraries, restaurants and clubs.
This project demonstrates the application of conditional logic and user input handling in Python to create engaging user interactions.
This project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, user interaction and input handling.<br>

<b>2. Holiday Cost Calculator:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> This Python program offers a simple yet effective tool for calculating the total cost of a holiday, incorporating expenses such as flights, hotel stay and car rentals.
By inputting the number of nights for the stay, the program calculates the hotel costs assuming a fixed price per night.
It's designed to help users budget their holidays more effectively by providing quick cost estimates.
This project showcases Python programming concepts, including functions, input handling and arithmetic operations.<br>

<b>3. Insurance Cost Prediction Model:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> This Jupyter Notebook presents a regression analysis aimed at predicting insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status and number of children.
The project covers the entire data science workflow including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model selection and evaluation.
It highlights the application of regression models in real-world predictions and decision-making processes.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.<br>

<b>4. Life Expectancy Analysis and Prediction:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> Focused on global health data, this project analyzes factors influencing life expectancy using exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.
It aims to uncover significant predictors of life expectancy across different countries and utilises machine learning models to predict life expectancy based on demographic and health indicators.
The notebook demonstrates data cleaning, visualization and machine learning in Python, using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.<br>

<b>5. Simple Linear Regression Example:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the application of simple linear regression to predict a dependent variable based on a single independent variable.
Through a step-by-step approach, it explains how to prepare data, fit a linear regression model and evaluate its performance.
This project serves as a foundational example of applying statistical models to real-world data.
Technologies Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.<br>

<b>6. Library Database System:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> This is a sophisticated Python application backed by an SQLite database, designed to manage library operations such as tracking book loans, returns and member registrations.
Utilizing an in-memory database for demonstration purposes, this system showcases the implementation of a database within a Python application through the use of the sqlite3 module.
Key features include the ability to set up a database schema, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and manage book loans with due dates calculated using the datetime module.
This project highlights skills in database management, object-oriented programming and the integration of Python with SQL to create functional and practical applications.<br>

<b>7. Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews:</b> <br>
<b>Description:</b> This project utilises Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. The aim is to classify reviews into positive, negative or neutral categories, providing valuable insights into customer sentiment regarding Amazon products. The project involves data preprocessing, sentiment analysis using Python, Pandas, spaCy, TextBlob and Jupyter Notebook as well as evaluation of model performance with insights into its strengths and limitations. The analysis (...Sentiment Analysis Report.docx) is based on a dataset comprising a wide range of information related to Amazon product reviews.<br>
