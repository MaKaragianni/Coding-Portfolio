My GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository is a collection of my personal projects, showcasing my programming skills and my passion for developing various software solutions.
Below is an overview of the projects included in this main folder.

1. Chatbox Program:
This is a chatbot program named "UniBuddy," designed to assist university freshmen. It interacts with users, collecting information such as name, favorite color, age, and country. The bot provides personalized responses and can answer predefined questions about various university-related topics like sports, student support, libraries, restaurants, and clubs. This project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, user interaction and input handling.

2. Library Database System:
This project is an enhanced library management system using Python and SQLite3. It includes features for managing users and books, tracking borrowing and returns and ensuring efficient data handling.

3. holiday.py:
This Python program is managing holiday-related data that could be used for planning or tracking. It's an excercise I enjoyed and thought it could be useful in a real-life scenario.

4. Insurance Regression:
This is a Jupyter notebook that performs regression analysis on insurance data (using insurance.csv) to predict premiums based on age, sex, etc, using Python and libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-Learn.

5. Simple Linear Regression:
This notebook demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict how the salary would change based on years of experience (using salary_data.csv) to showcase data analysis and modeling with Python and Scikit-Learn.

6. Life Expectancy Model
This notebook analyses the data in the file life_expectancy_data.csv, employing data manipulation and visualisation techniques, and predictive modeling with Python. 

I am always eager to learn and grow, and I hope this portfolio provides a glimpse into my coding journey and capabilities.
Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or any queries about my projects.
